# Open in VSCode

VSCode does not enable opening folders from the macOS context menu (ctrl-click),
this package does!

## Installation

1. First make sure 'code' is added to your PATH

![add code to path](./docs/img/add-code-to-PATH.png)

2. run `npx install-open-in-vscode`
3. ensure that the option is enabled under
   `System Settings.app/General/Login Items and Extensions/Finder`

![]()

## Usage

![open in vscode context menu](docs/img/context-menu.png)

If the option is not immediately in the context menu, it is likely under
`Services` or `Quick Actions`
