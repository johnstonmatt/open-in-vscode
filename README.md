# Open in VSCode

VSCode does not enable opening folders from the context menu (ctrl-click), this package does!

## Installation

1) First make sure 'code' is added to your PATH

![add code to path](https://serveon.site/vscode-add-to-path.png)


2) run `npx install-open-in-vscode`


## Usage

![open in vscode context menu](https://serveon.site/open-in-vscode-context-menu.png)

If the option is not immediately in the context menu, it is likely under `Services`
